## Getting Started

We have a demo version of the platform on this url: <a href="https://regenwise.net">DemoUrl</a>

If you want to run the project on your local machine, read the steps below:

### Steps To Run The DApp On Your Local Machine

* First you should clone this repo to your local machine.
* After you get inside the cloned folder, you should install required packages with the command below:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
* If you do not already have it, install Metamask wallet to your browser and connect it to Polygon Mumbai Testnet. (You can find how to do these on the net, it is easy.)

* You should add .env file in .\regenwise-frontend\ directory and inside it there should be your testnet account's private key named as NEXT_PUBLIC_key1 .


* Then run the command below:
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
